# ML-Assignment

This CNN was made for a machine learning assignment and is designed to work with the MNIST Fashion dataset. It's purpose is to select the most expensive type of item when presented with an image. Each image contains 3 items. The `a3_CNN.ipynb` file can be opened in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com "Google Colab") or  [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/ "Jupyter")  but cannot be run due to missing training data. For more information or if you have any questions, please contact me directly.

Trained and tested on 60,000 images with 10 class labels. Achieved an accuracy of approx. 86%.
